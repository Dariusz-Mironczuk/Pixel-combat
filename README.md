# Pixel-combat
A pixel art mortal combat like game.

I made it based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5bd9KMSSW4
So a big thanks to 'Coding With Russ'!

What I did was rewrote the entire game so it's object oriented programming.
This makes it much easier for anyone to change and add to the code.
